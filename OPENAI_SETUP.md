# OpenAI Integration Setup Guide

## 🤖 BusTracker AI Assistant Setup

Your chatbot has been upgraded to use OpenAI's GPT for intelligent responses instead of hardcoded answers!

### 📋 Setup Steps

1. **Get OpenAI API Key:**
   - Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

2. **Configure Environment:**
   - Open `.env` file in the root directory
   - Replace `your-openai-api-key-here` with your actual API key:
   ```
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
   ```

3. **Test the Integration:**
   - Start your application: `npm run dev`
   - Open the chatbot
   - Ask questions like:
     - "Tell me about BusTracker"
     - "Who will be managing you?"
     - "What are your capabilities?"
     - "How do delays work?"

### 🎯 What Changed

**Before:** Hardcoded responses based on keyword matching
**Now:** AI-powered responses using OpenAI GPT that understands context and provides relevant BusTracker-specific answers
